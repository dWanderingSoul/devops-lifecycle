# DevOps-Lifecycle
# DevOps Lifecycle Project

## üìò Overview
This repository demonstrates an understanding of DevOps principles and the complete software delivery lifecycle. It outlines how development and operations collaborate to deliver high-quality software efficiently and reliably.

---

## üöÄ What is DevOps?
DevOps is a **cultural and technical approach** that unifies software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to accelerate software delivery while maintaining quality, stability, and reliability. It focuses on breaking silos, fostering collaboration, and automating workflows across the software lifecycle.

---

## üîë Core DevOps Principles

- **Collaboration**: Bridging the gap between development and operations teams for seamless communication.
- **Automation**: Streamlining workflows using CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure as code (IaC).
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enhancing systems iteratively based on feedback and performance data.
- **Customer Focus**: Prioritizing end-user value through frequent and reliable software releases.

## üîÅ DevOps Lifecycle Stages

1. **Planning**  
   Define requirements and establish project roadmaps using agile methods and collaboration tools.

2. **Development**  
   Write and manage code in version control systems (e.g., Git), applying branching strategies and peer reviews.

3. **Building**  
   Compile source code and generate deployable artifacts using automated build tools and containerization (e.g., Docker).

4. **Testing**  
   Validate code through unit, integration, and security tests to ensure stability and functionality.

5. **Release**  
   Prepare and version tested code, ensuring all approvals and documentation are complete before deployment.

6. **Deployment**  
   Deliver the application to production using automated deployment pipelines and infrastructure provisioning tools (e.g., Ansible, Terraform).

7. **Operations**  
   Manage live applications by monitoring performance, ensuring uptime, and applying necessary updates or patches.

8. **Monitoring**  
   Continuously track system health, performance metrics, and user behavior using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack to guide improvements.
